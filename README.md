# streamtablefm
A nifty way to create a listening room on stream.place

You'll need to get your own stream key by logging into https://stream.place

If you don't like the train bg, edit entrypoint.sh and pick another video.

System only supports YT for now, but more to come later.

This is just a first pass, so by all means download it, mod it, and make it your own.
